# hypoglycaemia_error_grid

In the other file you will find the code you will need to analyse your data, create a Hypoglycaemia Error Grid (HEG) and plot your paired values on the HEG.
This is designed to be run on a Jupyter notebook, run through Anaconda but I'm sure it would work equally well elsewhere. 
There are almost endless alterations that can be made to the code to make small and interesting changes to the grid. 

If you would like any advice on how to use the grid please contact chris.worth@mft.nhs.uk and I'd be delighted to help. 

Please feel free to use this grid for plotting your paired CGM and glucometer values for patients with CHI. 
We'd love to see your results and compare them with those from our patients so please get in touch. 

Chris
